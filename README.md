this mini project involves deconstructing and rebuilding an existing webpage.
Note: the html file is used to code what goes on the page, and the css file is used to code the layout i.e. positioning, colors, and shades.
Note: <a> indicates a hyperlink in a html file, but will only work when the 'href' attribute is present.
Note: in css the '#' is an id selector and the '.' is a class selector
